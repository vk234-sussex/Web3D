The above are Unity AssetBundles, due to this project not using X3D and instead making use of Unity for higher fidelity rendering. These bundles contain compressed models, textures, shaders and materials, alongside component information.

Please refer to the <a href="unity_project/Assets/BundleData/Models/">./unity_project/Assets/BundleData/Models/</a> directory, which is split by each bundle that will be compiled, and contains all the relevant data stored within the bundle.

Unity requests these files using the `data.php` script, in the directory above; this ensures the correct headers are set on these files. Please also refer to <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vk234-sussex/Web3D/main/assetbundle_backend/manifest.json">../manifest.json</a>, generated by the tool I developed for this, which Unity references as it's lookup table to load data from.
